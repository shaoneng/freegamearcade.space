It features a massive 3D open-world city and combines realistic driving physics with a variety of fun game modes. You're not limited to just parking; this game lets you race through traffic, drift, crash into cars, complete timed missions, and freely explore the map.</p><p>You earn coins by completing tasks or collecting money bags scattered on the map. Head to the garage to unlock better, faster cars with your coins. Whether you prefer mission-based challenges or free-roam chaos, this game has something for every type of driving fan. The game supports both single-player and local two-player modes.</p><h3>Race Mode</h3><p>Put your skills to the test against a friend and two CPU-controlled cars. There are 10 unique tracks designed with tight corners, city traffic, and open stretches. The first to cross the finish line wins, but catching up is tough if you fall behind. Timing your NOS boost and mastering the corners will make all the difference.</p><h3>Parking Mode</h3><p>Test your parking precision with timed goals across 20 different realistic parking scenarios. These aren't just simple park-and-go tasks; you'll need to maneuver around tight corners and avoid barriers before the clock runs out. Be careful, as every bump damages your car, and your health bar is always ticking down.</p><h3>Precision Mode</h3><p>This mode takes parking to the next level. You'll need to drive through small checkpoints and park perfectly in highlighted spots. It's a true test of control where each level gets more complex and the time limit shrinks, demanding patience and smooth handling.</p><h3>Crash Mode</h3><p>Your mission is to cause as much chaos as possible by hitting other cars. Every crash earns you points, and even a slight bump will make other cars explode. The more cars you destroy, the more coins you'll earn when the round ends. Itâ€™s all about destruction, not speed.</p><h3>Traffic Run Mode</h3><p>Weave through busy traffic lanes and overtake civilian cars without crashing. Each successful overtake adds to your score, allowing you to unlock better sports cars for your next run. It's one of the most rewarding and challenging modes.</p><h3>Drift Mode</h3><p>Get your speed over 80 km/h and then steer sharply to pull off long drifts around corners, collecting points along the way. You'll need smooth entries, tight control, and the ability to maintain your angle without hitting a wall. Rack up a high score and prove you're the drift king.</p><h3>Free Roam Mode</h3><p>No goals, no pressure. Just you and the open city. Drive wherever you want, explore ramps, jump off rooftops, or just practice your skills. This mode is perfect for relaxing between intense challenges or finding hidden money bags.</p></div></section>
