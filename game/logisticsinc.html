You start with a small amount of cash, a few employees, and a dream. Your first step is to purchase a bicycle by clicking the "BUY 1" button. Once you have a vehicle, assign an employee to it by clicking the plus sign in the Staff column. A staffed vehicle will start completing orders and earning you money.</p><p>As your profits grow, reinvest them into expanding your fleet. After purchasing five of one vehicle type, you will unlock the next tier: from bikes to vans, trucks, planes, and eventually massive ships. Remember that larger vehicles can handle bigger, more profitable orders but often require more than one employee to operate. Balance your vehicle purchases with your hiring rate to ensure steady growth.</p><p>Your staff are the lifeblood of your operation. You can assign them to vehicles to generate income or to specialized departments to unlock crucial upgrades. Place a worker in HR to start recruiting new staff automatically for free. If you need a quick workforce boost and have cash to spare, unlock Contractors through the R&D department for instant hires.</p><p>To truly scale your business, you must invest in the three key support departments. The Research & Development (R&D) department unlocks powerful upgrades that increase efficiency and reduce costs. The Marketing department ensures you always have a steady stream of orders for your fleet. Finally, the Vehicle Maintenance department keeps your fleet running at 100% speed, which is vital for maximizing profits. Don't forget to upskill your mechanics so they can work on more advanced vehicles!</p><p>The ultimate goal in Logistics Inc is to create a perfectly balanced, self-sustaining business empire. Juggle your staff, manage your fleet, and make smart investments to watch your company's valuation skyrocket. Use the purchase multipliers (x10, MAX) to expand rapidly and dominate the global shipping market.</p></div></section>
