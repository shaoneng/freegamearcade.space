<p>Your journey begins with a small team, a tiny bank account, and a single bicycle line. Your first move is to click the "BUY 1" button next to the bike row to purchase your first vehicle. Once you do, orders will appear on the left. To get things moving, assign an employee to the bike by clicking the plus sign in the Staff column. A staffed vehicle completes deliveries and earns money; an empty one does nothing.</p>
<p>To grow your empire, reinvest your earnings into new vehicles. After purchasing five of one vehicle type (e.g., bikes), you'll unlock the next tier, such as vans, trucks, planes, and ships. Purchase at least one of each new type as it becomes available. Remember that larger vehicles like planes and ships require multiple workers to operate. Keep assigning staff to your new vehicles to fulfill bigger, more profitable orders.</p>
<p>Your staff are your most valuable asset. To grow your team without spending cash, assign a worker to the HR department. This will start an automatic, free recruitment timer. For faster growth, unlock the "Contractors" upgrade in the Research & Development (R&D) tree, which allows you to hire staff instantly for a price. Ensure no employee is ever left unassigned to maximize your efficiency.</p>
<p>The R&D department is your key to exponential growth. While staff assigned here don't generate direct income, they unlock powerful upgrades that improve efficiency, speed up hiring, and boost marketing. Investing in R&D early on, especially in upgrades like "Efficiency" or "Improved HR," will significantly accelerate your progress throughout the game.</p>
<p>An idle fleet is a profit drain. Use the Marketing department to ensure a steady stream of orders. Assign staff to different marketing strategies for bikes, vans, trucks, and more. Each person assigned adds a bonus to the number of incoming orders for that vehicle type. Additionally, keep an eye on Vehicle Maintenance. As vehicles are used, their condition degrades. Hire mechanics and assign them to keep your fleet running at 100% speed. Don't forget to upskill your mechanics so they can work on more advanced vehicles!</p>
<p>As your revenue grows, use the purchase multipliers at the top (x10, MAX) to buy vehicles in bulk and expand rapidly. The ultimate goal is to create a perfectly balanced operation: all staff are busy, order queues are full, all vehicles are maintained, and your profits are skyrocketing. Master the logistics, and build a billion-dollar empire!</p>
