<p>"Emma's afternoon hit a wall at exactly 3:17 PM. Her inbox chimed again, another urgent task from her manager. Minimized the spreadsheet and opened Solitaire... She leaned back, chest light as if she'd conquered something bigger than a simple deal. Back at her desk, she reopened that spreadsheet. The numbers looked friendlier now."</p>
<p>This story comes from one of our players (we've tweaked names and a few details to keep her privacy, but the feeling is all theirs). As she says, "Sometimes, all it takes is a quiet moment and a deck of cards to turn the tide of a long workday." Just like Emma, you can step away from the buzz and dive into that calming world of solitaire. See how a simple deck of cards can brighten any day.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-apple-text mt-6 mb-3">Make a Wish!</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard that each round of Solitaire is a small test of fate? Before you start the game, think of a simple wish. Anything from "I hope I ace tomorrow's presentation" to "I wish for a sunny weekend." Then play as you normally would. If you clear the deck, legend says your wish is on its way to coming true. Give it a go and see what the cards decide!</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-apple-text mt-6 mb-3">Game Objective</h3>
<p>Solitaire is a single-player card game where the main goal is to sort all 52 cards into four foundation piles, one for each suit, in ascending order from Ace to King.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-apple-text mt-6 mb-3">How to Play</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
    <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Seven piles of cards are laid out. The top card of each is face-up.</li>
    <li><strong>Stockpile:</strong> The remaining cards form a face-down pile you can draw from.</li>
    <li><strong>Foundation:</strong> Four empty piles where you will build your suits from Ace to King.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mt-4">Click "New Game" to start. Drag a face-up card (or a sequence) onto another tableau pile if it's the opposite color and one rank lower (e.g., a red 6 on a black 7). Click the stockpile to draw new cards one by one. Move Aces to the foundation piles to start building them up to the King.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-apple-text mt-6 mb-3">How to Win</h3>
<p>You win by moving every card into the four foundation piles, each stacked from Ace through King. A game ends when no cards remain on the tableau, stock, or waste piles.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-apple-text mt-6 mb-3">Solitaire FAQ</h3>
<div class="space-y-4">
    <div><p><strong>Is Solitaire a game of skill or luck?</strong></p><p>Solitaire combines both. It takes skill to decide which moves to make, when to draw from the stock, and how to uncover hidden cards. But it also takes some luck as the initial shuffle affects how many cards are accessible early on.</p></div>
    <div><p><strong>What are some good strategies for beginners?</strong></p><p>First, try to find the aces and twos. Then, prioritize moves that uncover face-down cards. Try not to empty a pile if you don't have a King ready to place. Use the undo button to try different moves if you get stuck.</p></div>
    <div><p><strong>Is Draw 1 or Draw 3 easier?</strong></p><p>Draw 1 is easier, which is what this version uses. Draw 3 is more challenging. With Draw 1, you can clear cards more easily and have a more relaxing experience.</p></div>
    <div><p><strong>Can I undo a move?</strong></p><p>Yes. Click the Undo button at any time to reverse your last move. Click on redo to move it again.</p></div>
    <div><p><strong>Is this game free?</strong></p><p>Yes, Solitaire on OnlineGames.io is 100% free. It doesn't ask for sign-ups or downloads. Just load the page and click "New Game."</p></div>
