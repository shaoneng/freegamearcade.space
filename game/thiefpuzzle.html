            <p>Thief Puzzle is a funny and clever story puzzle game where you play as a sneaky thief with one superpower: a stretchy arm that can reach almost anything! His arm is so elastic that he can even hug the Statue of Liberty. But getting what you want isn't easy. You'll have to sneak past traps, dodge obstacles, and avoid setting off wild chain reactions just to grab your prize.</p>
            <p>Every level is like a mini cartoon with stickmen, complete with funny animations whether you win or fail. Your goal in each level is simple: grab the item. But the path is filled with traps, angry characters, fire hydrants, TNT barrels, and all kinds of objects that can ruin your perfect heist. Touch the wrong thing, and it's game over with a funny twist.</p>
            <p>What really makes Thief Puzzle stand out is the way each of its 400 levels feels like a little story. You're not just solving puzzles, you're living through short, animated scenes. In one level, you're in Paris trying to grab a suitcase. Another time, you'll stretch across a pirate ship to reach a golden treasure chest. The game keeps surprising you with new scenes, jokes, and challenges.</p>
